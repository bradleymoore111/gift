Level N: 2 gates, "leap frog" style of opening gates (think of using 2 jammers to get both through a gate from Talos Principle)

Do not work in free time. You're on reduced pay


Todo: 
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Make textures working (then figure out hitboxes)
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Implement no-jump walls that don't have to be fields
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Reset level on death
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Perhaps an innate reset function within each world level?
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Perhaps put the entire world data object into its own file, just for simpler level design. 
		Make world.js purely for rendering
		Make entities.js purely for interactions (it's OK if this and world have some overlap)
		Make a new data.js purely for storing world data
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
