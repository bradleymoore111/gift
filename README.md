Level N: 2 gates, "leap frog" style of opening gates (think of using 2 jammers to get both through a gate from Talos Principle)

Do not work in free time. You're on reduced pay

Todo: 
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Make textures working (then figure out hitboxes)
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Implement no-jump walls that don't have to be fields
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	<!-- Reset level on death -->
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	There had better be an existential crisis somewhere in this thing
	MAKE MORE LEVELS	
	<!-- Perhaps an innate reset function within each world level? -->
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	<!-- Perhaps put the entire world data object into its own file, just for simpler level design. 
		Make world.js purely for rendering
		Make entities.js purely for interactions (it's OK if this and world have some overlap)
		Make a new data.js purely for storing world data -->
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Perhaps all fields should have plates on both sides of them? For simplicity to the user
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	<!-- Make fields work possible to work based on multiple pressure plates where only one has to be open -->
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	Make goal.action() reset cubes, plates, keys, etc. (BUT NOT BREAD COUNT)
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	<!-- Implement quotes -->
	MAKE MORE LEVELS
	<!-- Implement snowman style banner announcements (useful for quotes given on picking up bread) -->
	MAKE MORE LEVELS


	Quotes to include somewhere  in the game:
		Listen with the intent to understand, not the intent to reply.
		People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
		If you're going through hell, keep going.
		A person is defined not by how they treat their equals, but by how they treat their inferiors.
		You never know the truth, only a truth.
		The last hope of the damned is not for salvation.

	For shits and giggles in the future, I should make a gui/engine for building levels. Cause why not.
